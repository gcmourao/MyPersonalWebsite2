I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Economics from the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Belo Horizonte/Brazil. Since the very beginning of the course I got passionate about Statistical Modeling after taking some Econometric courses.  After that, I decided to deepen my knowledge attending some additional courses like Calculus, Linear Algebra and Differential Equations in the University’s Statistics department.<br>
After my graduation, I had the opportunity to live in the biggest cities in Brazil: Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. My work experience includes banking and consultancy industries, always working in the Data Science field.<br>

In 2017 I got married and moved again. But this time we moved to a completely different place: Hong Kong! I took advantage from this change to apply for a Master program that had been my goal for a while.<br>
Nowadays, I’m Master of Science in Business Analytics Candidate at University of Hong Kong, and I can say that this experience has been amazing! Besides a lot of learning, the interaction with people from several different cultures has been a valuable experience. Hong Kong is an amazing cosmopolitan city, and it overcame our expectations. Surprisingly, we got settled in our new home very fast!<br>

# About my Blog: <br>
<br>
I decided to setup this Blog because I wanted to share the personal projects that I have been working on. Writing our thoughts in systematic way to come up with a shareable information it is not always easy, but I believe that we end up learning even more in this process. Besides that, the opportunity to have valuable feedbacks about my projects makes me feel excited for learning from new perspectives!<br>
This Blog was built using Hugo Themes (I’m using the tranquilpeak theme) powered by Blogdown package in R, which is my favorite programming language. Besides R, I also code in Python and SAS.<br>
I hope you enjoy my blog and I would be very happy to receive some feedbacks about it.<br>
